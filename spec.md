# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add the KidsLearn logo to the Home page and Header, and increase the sizes of text, numbers, and images throughout the app for better readability for kids.

**Planned changes:**
- Add the KidsLearn logo prominently at the top-center of the Home page hero area
- Add the KidsLearn logo inline in the sticky Header component next to the app name
- Increase font sizes for headings, numbers, and body text across NumbersLesson, Numbers100Lesson, AlphabetLesson, AlphabetFullScreen, Quiz, TimedChallenge, Lessons, VocabularyLesson, PictureLesson, KidsDashboard, and ProgressWidget (at least one Tailwind size step up for text, two steps for headings/numbers)
- Increase image and emoji container sizes by 25–40% in AlphabetLesson, AlphabetFullScreen, PictureLesson, VocabularyLesson, NumbersLesson, GameCard, LearningCard, and MiniGame

**User-visible outcome:** The app displays the KidsLearn logo in the header and home screen, and all text, numbers, and images are noticeably larger and easier for children to read and interact with.
