# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the KidsLearn app more visually engaging for young children by applying a bright, child-friendly color scheme and increasing the size of alphabet and number cards.

**Planned changes:**
- Apply a bright, vibrant, playful color scheme across all pages (Home, AlphabetLesson, NumbersLesson, Numbers100Lesson, MiniGame, MatchingGame, Quiz, VocabularyLesson, PoemsLesson, PuzzleGame, TimedChallenge, and others) — replacing any muted or adult-oriented colors with bold, saturated, high-contrast colors on backgrounds, buttons, cards, navigation, and interactive elements
- Increase the font size of alphabet letters on cards in AlphabetLesson significantly (e.g., 4xl–6xl or larger)
- Increase the font size of number digits on cards in NumbersLesson and Numbers100Lesson significantly
- Make alphabet and number cards larger and more tappable overall

**User-visible outcome:** The app looks colorful and fun for young children, with large, easy-to-read letters and numbers on bigger, tappable cards throughout all lesson pages.
