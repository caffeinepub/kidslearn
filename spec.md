# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enhance the KidsLearn app's Alphabet, Poems, and Numbers sections with multilingual content (English, Telugu, Hindi, Tamil), illustrated cards, and text-to-speech support.

**Planned changes:**
- Upgrade the Alphabet & Letters section to show large, colorful letter cards for all 4 languages, each displaying the letter, a relevant illustrated image, and the example word in all 4 languages; add a language selector and tap-to-speak via Web Speech API
- Upgrade the Poems & Nursery Rhymes section with at least 3 pre-built classic poems per language (English, Telugu, Hindi, Tamil) displayed in native script on colorful cards, with a read-aloud button using Web Speech API and a language tab/filter
- Upgrade the Numbers section to show numbers 1–20 as large colorful cards, each displaying the digit, number word in all 4 languages in native script, and an emoji visual count; add tap-to-speak via Web Speech API with a language selector
- Add 26 custom illustrated alphabet images (A–Z) as static assets used on each alphabet letter card

**User-visible outcome:** Children can explore letters, poems, and numbers in English, Telugu, Hindi, and Tamil with illustrated cards, native-script text, and audio pronunciation at the tap of a button.
