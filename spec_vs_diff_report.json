  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 (child-friendly color scheme) and REQ-2 (larger alphabet/number cards) across the app. A vibrant custom color palette (sunshine, grass, tangerine, cherry, sky, lavender, mint, coral) is defined in tailwind.config.js and applied across all major pages. AlphabetLesson, NumbersLesson, and Numbers100Lesson all show enlarged font sizes for letters/numbers. Most pages listed in REQ-1 are covered. One gap is the MiniGame page which is not visible in the diff, making it unclear if it received the color treatment.",
