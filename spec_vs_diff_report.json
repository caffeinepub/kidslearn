  "summary": "The diff implements AlphabetLesson.tsx, NumbersLesson.tsx, and PoemsLesson.tsx with multilingual content, TTS via Web Speech API, language selectors, emoji counts, and colorful kid-friendly UI. All three core content sections (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3) appear implemented in the source. However, REQ-4 requires actual image files placed in frontend/public/assets/generated — the diff shows no added files, meaning the 26 illustrated PNG assets were not added to the repository.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Generate and display custom illustrated image assets for the alphabet section (one picture per letter in English, A–Z, 26 images), to be placed in frontend/public/assets/generated as static files.",
      "reason": "The diff shows zero added files. The AlphabetLesson.tsx references image paths like '/assets/generated/alphabet-a.dim_200x200.png' through alphabet-z, but none of the 26 PNG image files were added to the repository. The 'ADDED FILES: none' section confirms no image assets were created.",
