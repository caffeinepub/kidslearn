  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 are substantially implemented. REQ-1 teacher removal is complete across frontend components and backend. REQ-2 UPI QR code is displayed with correct UPI ID and label. One minor AC for REQ-1 regarding the /teacher-dashboard route is partially addressed (page shows a redirect message but route still exists). The QR code image path uses a generated asset path but cannot confirm the actual image file was added as a static asset.",

      "reason": "The TeacherDashboard page still exists as a component showing a 'Page Not Available' message. App.tsx summary mentions the route was removed, but the file itself was not removed. App.tsx is truncated so full confirmation is not possible.",
